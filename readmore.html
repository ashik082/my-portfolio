            <p style="font-size: 1.8rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
                I'm <span style="color: var(--main-color); font-weight: 600;">Ashik</span>, a dedicated third-year undergraduate student pursuing a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering at Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET). Passionate about software development and problem-solving, I focus on building responsive, user-centric web applications using modern technologies such as the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), Firebase, and RESTful APIs.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.8rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
                Driven by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning, I'm currently expanding my expertise into artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing to stay at the forefront of technological innovation. My approach to development blends clean, efficient code with a strong emphasis on usability, performance, and scalability.

            <p style="font-size: 1.8rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
                Beyond coding, I thrive in collaborative environments—whether participating in hackathons, contributing to team projects, or engaging in technical discussions. I believe that the best solutions emerge when analytical rigor meets creative thinking, and I strive to build applications that not only function well but also deliver meaningful, real-world impact.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.8rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 3rem;">
                My long-term goal is to develop accessible, human-centered technologies that improve everyday experiences—crafting digital solutions that are as thoughtful as they are functional.
